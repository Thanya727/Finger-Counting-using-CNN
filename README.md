# Finger-Counting-using-Hand-Tracking
This project focuses on the development of a robust finger classification system using deep learning techniques to enhance human-computer interaction. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to classify images of hand gestures, specifically focusing on individual fingers. The goal is to accurately identify and label each finger, allowing for precise gesture recognition and interpretation. The dataset comprises images of hands with various poses, capturing diverse finger configurations to ensure the model's adaptability to different user gestures.

The finger classification model serves as a crucial component in applications such as sign language recognition, virtual reality interactions, and touchless user interfaces. By harnessing the power of deep learning, the system can decipher complex hand gestures, enabling seamless communication between users and devices. The project aims to contribute to the advancement of intuitive and inclusive human-computer interaction methods, fostering a more accessible and responsive technological landscape.
